# StorkeCentral

Enhanced information access platform for UCSB students.

### This is the original codebase for v1 of StorkeCentral.
It was worked on during fall quarter of 2021, development was lead by Bharat Kathi.

A brand new rewrite was started in winter quarter of 2022, which you can now see in the main branch of this repository.
The main reason for this rewrite was to develop backend services to support user accounts, up-to-date data retrieval, and most importantly, class schedules.

Development of the backend took priority for winter and most of spring quarter in 2022. Once the 3 main microservices were completed (montecito, lacumbre, rincon), frontend development began once agian. It was decided to do a full rewrite of the existing codebase for a couple reasons. The biggest one was the release of Flutter 3.0 at the end of March 2021.

Over the course of summer 2021, development of the new frontend went into full swing, and the rest, as they say is history (main branch lol).
